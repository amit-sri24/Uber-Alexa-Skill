# Setup

1. All configuraton and user-specific variables are handled inside of `config/default.json`. Copy `config/sample.json` to `config/default.json` and fill out the appropriate fields. You will need to provide all of your API keys. For Uber, you will need a valid token from oAuth2.0 which is currently up to you. Optionally add a Forecast.io weather API key (`Weather.api-key`).

```js
{
  	"Uber": {
		"client_id": "required",
		"client_secret": "required",
		"server_token": "required",
		"redirect_uri": "optional",
		"access_token":"required",
		"sandbox" : true
	},
    "Alexa": {
		"location": { "latitude": required, "longitude": required },
		"lambda-arn" : "required"
    },
    "Weather" : {
    	"api-key" : "optional"
    }
}
```

2. Create a new Alexa skill andÂ use the provided info in `interaction-model.txt` for your Intent Schema and Sample Utterences, as well as Custom Slot Types.

3. Upload code to your lambda function. `gruntFile.js` has been configured to upload to you Lambda function. You can deploy to Lambda using `grunt deploy`. See https://github.com/Tim-B/grunt-aws-lambda for more info

4. Configure lambda function. Make sure you set the handler to `skill.handler` and add an `Alexa Skills Kit` event source.

# Notes

- The main entry point for the code is `skill.js` which uses boilerplate Skill code from Amazon. This is where most of the Alexa and speech code lives.
- `uber-skill-handler.js` contains most of the code dealing with the Uber API.
- Provides a `sandbox` flag in config for testing.
